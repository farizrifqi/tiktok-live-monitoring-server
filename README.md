# Advanced TikTok Live Server

This is the Express.js version of the server for **[Adv-TTL-Client](https://github.com/farizrifqi/adv-ttl-client)**, a project designed to interact with TikTok Livestreams.

This server uses **[TikTok-Live-Connector](https://github.com/zerodytrash/TikTok-Live-Connector/)** to connect to TikTok Livestreams and relay real-time events such as chat messages, gifts, likes, and more to the client.

---

## Features

-   **Real-time TikTok Live Events**: Listen to live events such as chat messages, gifts, likes, shares, follows, and more.
-   **WebSocket Support**: Uses WebSocket to provide real-time updates to the client.
-   **Proxy Support**: Allows the use of proxies to bypass regional restrictions.
-   **Reconnection Logic**: Automatically reconnects to the TikTok Livestream if the connection is lost.
-   **Room Info Retrieval**: Fetches room information (e.g., viewer count, stream status) when connecting to a livestream.
-   **History Tracking**: Keeps track of usernames that have been listened to.
-   Stream Proxy is available under `/proxy-stream/` route. For the Cloudflare Worker version, visit **[Adv-TTL-Proxy-Worker](https://github.com/farizrifqi/adv-ttl-proxy-worker)**.

    GET /proxy-stream/:url/
    ```

-   `self:history`: Sends the history of listened usernames.

## Configuration

The server is configured to run on port `2608` by default. You can change this by modifying the `PORT` variable in `index.js`.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required for basic usage. However, if you need to use a proxy, you can pass the proxy configuration via the `listenToUsername` event.
